<h2>CISA’s Recommendation on Intelligence Writing, Why it Matters, and How to Write for Intelligence</h2>

<br />

<h2>CISA’s recommendation on how to write for Intelligence</h2>

<h3>Before I Start Writing & while I’m writing – ASK THE FOLLOWING TO KNOW THE AUDIENCE:</h3>

(1) Who will be reading my workproduct, or who will I be briefing to?

(2) How much does my audience already know about the subject?

(3) Why does my audience care?

(4) How will my audience use (or how would I like for the audience to use) the information I give them?

(5) When is the workproduct due?

<h2>What intelligence writing isn’t…</h2>

It's not academic writing!

<h3>How academic writing usually goes:</h3>


<b>Introduction</b>

What the paper is going to be about.

Why I’m writing about this particular topic.

How the paper is organized.

The research methodology – how I went about doing my research & the time frame therein.

<b>Historical Background</b>

History of a prior assessment on the research topic.

<b>The Body of the Paper</b>

Diving into details…

<b>Conclusion</b>

Wrap up everything in a nice summary.

<h3>Takeaway: <br />
<br />
This is actually THE OPPOSITE WAY of how one should do intelligence writing.</h3>

<h2>How I ought to write as a CTI:</h2>

<h4>Why Cyber Threat Intelligence Writing is this way:</h4>

+ Decision-makers usually do not have time to read my entire document just to get to my conclusions. Instead…<br />

+ Decision-makers want to know – RIGHT UP FRONT – what they need to know. <br />

Different brands, organizations, companies, may differ in order or naming conventions than what is displayed above, but... <br />

Everyone will agree on the following things:<br />
<br />
<br />

1. KEEP THE BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT.<br />
<br />

2. Followed by Key Judgments. <br />
